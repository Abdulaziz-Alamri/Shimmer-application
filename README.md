# Food Offer App

A simple flutter project showing the UI implementation of a food offers app where users can check offers to order.


## Work

- Used Shimmer library to create a waiting time for images to be rendered, it adds a special visual that is used widely in apps nowadays.
- Used Stack to control the position of each widget.
- Created two custom widgets for better maintainability and reusability.
- Used a BottomNavigationBar.

- Issues to be fixed:

- *The images in circles are a little smaller than the size desired*


## UI

- Note: A video of UI is uploaded in assets/video
